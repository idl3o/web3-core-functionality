# Smart Contract Catalog

This document provides an overview of all smart contracts used in the Web3 Crypto Streaming Service platform. These contracts form the backbone of our decentralized streaming ecosystem.

## Core Contracts

| Contract | Description | Location | Version |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| StreamAccessContract | Manages access control for streaming content | [GitHub](https://github.com/idl3o/contracts/blob/main/StreamAccessContract.sol) | v1.0.0 |
| ProofOfExistence | Verifies and timestamps content authenticity | [GitHub](https://github.com/idl3o/contracts/blob/main/ProofOfExistence.sol) | v1.0.0 |
| StreamingToken | Manages the platform's utility token | [GitHub](https://github.com/idl3o/contracts/blob/main/StreamingToken.sol) | v1.0.0 |
| StreamPayment | Handles streaming payment models | [GitHub](https://github.com/idl3o/contracts/blob/main/StreamPayment.sol) | v1.0.0 |

## StreamAccessContract

This contract manages access control for crypto streaming content, ensuring that only authorized users can access premium content.

### Key Features:
- Content registration with customizable access models
- Pay-per-view and subscription-based access control
- Royalty and platform fee management
- Authorization verification

### Main Functions:
```solidity
function registerContent(bytes32 contentId, uint256 price, bool isPremium, uint256 royaltyPercent, string memory contentHash)
function purchaseAccess(bytes32 contentId, uint256 duration)
function hasAccess(bytes32 contentId, address user)
function grantAccess(bytes32 contentId, address user, uint256 duration)
```

### Implementation Details:
The contract uses a dual-mapping structure to efficiently track both content metadata and user access rights. It implements a flexible monetization system that allows creators to set their own prices and access models.

## ProofOfExistence

This contract provides a mechanism for establishing proof of content ownership and existence at a specific point in time.

### Key Features:
- Immutable timestamping of content hashes on the blockchain
- Quantum signature support for enhanced security
- Confidence level tracking for content verification
- Efficient verification process

### Main Functions:
```solidity
function registerProof(bytes32 contentHash, bytes32 quantumSignature, uint256 confidence)
function verifyProof(bytes32 contentHash)
function getProofDetails(bytes32 contentHash)
```

### Implementation Details:
Using the blockchain's immutable ledger, this contract creates tamper-proof records of when specific content was registered, helping to resolve intellectual property disputes and verify content authenticity.

## StreamingToken

Our platform's native ERC20 utility token that powers the ecosystem.

### Key Features:
- Credit purchasing system
- Stream access management
- Utility functions for the platform economy

### Main Functions:
```solidity
function purchaseCredits()
function startStream(string memory contentId)
function canStream(address user, string memory contentId)
```

### Implementation Details:
This ERC20 token includes specialized functions for the streaming platform, allowing users to convert ETH to streaming credits and use those credits to access content.

## StreamPayment

This contract enables continuous payment streams for content consumption, creating a more granular and fair compensation model for creators.

### Key Features:
- Per-second payment streaming
- Dynamic fund management
- Creator-viewer direct payments
- Adjustable payment rates

### Main Functions:
```solidity
function createStream(address recipient, uint256 ratePerSecond)
function addFunds(bytes32 streamId)
function stopStream(bytes32 streamId)
function withdraw(bytes32 streamId)
```

### Implementation Details:
The contract implements a time-based payment channel that allows viewers to stream payments to creators at a specified rate per second, with the ability to pause, resume, and adjust the payment flow.

## Security Considerations

All platform smart contracts incorporate:

- Comprehensive access controls
- Re-entrancy protection
- Integer overflow/underflow protection (using Solidity 0.8+)
- Event emission for all significant state changes
- Explicit visibility modifiers
