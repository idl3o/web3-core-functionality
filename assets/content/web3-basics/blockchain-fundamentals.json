      "html": "<p>At its core, a blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers.</p><p>Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, forming a chain of blocksâ€”hence the name 'blockchain.'</p><p>This structure makes the blockchain immutable, as changing any information would require altering all subsequent blocks, which is computationally infeasible.</p>"

    {
      "title": "Blockchain Structure",
      "html": "<p>A blockchain consists of connected blocks, each containing:</p><ul><li><strong>Block Header</strong>: Contains metadata like the timestamp, nonce (a number used in mining), and a reference to the previous block's hash.</li><li><strong>Transaction Data</strong>: The actual information being stored, such as cryptocurrency transfers or smart contract interactions.</li><li><strong>Hash</strong>: A cryptographic fingerprint that uniquely identifies the block's contents.</li></ul><p>The hash of each block is calculated using the block's contents and the previous block's hash, creating an unbreakable chain. If any data in a block changes, its hash changes too, breaking the chain.</p>"

      "title": "Consensus Mechanisms",
      "html": "<p>Blockchain networks use consensus mechanisms to agree on the state of the ledger without central authority.</p><p>The two most common consensus mechanisms are:</p><ul><li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong>: Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. Used by Bitcoin and (formerly) Ethereum.</li><li><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS)</strong>: Validators stake cryptocurrency to participate in block validation. More energy-efficient than PoW. Used by Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, and Solana.</li></ul><p>Other consensus mechanisms include Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Proof of Authority (PoA), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).</p>",

      "title": "Immutability and Security",
      "html": "<p>Blockchain's immutability comes from:</p><ul><li><strong>Cryptographic Hashing</strong>: Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a tamper-evident chain.</li><li><strong>Distributed Nature</strong>: The blockchain is stored across many nodes in a network, making it difficult for an attacker to compromise the majority.</li><li><strong>Consensus</strong>: Nodes must agree on the state of the blockchain, preventing malicious actors from altering records.</li></ul><p>To successfully attack a blockchain, an attacker would need to control over 51% of the network's computing power (in PoW) or stake (in PoS), which is increasingly difficult as networks grow larger.</p>"
