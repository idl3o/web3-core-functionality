      "title": "What is Game Theory?",
      "html": "<p>Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. In blockchain systems, it helps us understand how participants behave when their actions affect each other's outcomes.</p><p>Blockchain protocols must be designed with game theory in mind to ensure that all participants are incentivized to follow the rules, creating a secure, functional system even when some actors may try to behave selfishly.</p>"

      "title": "Rational vs. Human Actors",
      "html": "<p>Blockchain systems must account for two distinct types of participants:</p><ul><li><strong>Rational Actors (Bots)</strong>: These participants always make mathematically optimal decisions that maximize their self-interest. They act predictably according to mathematical principles.</li><li><strong>Human Actors</strong>: Real people who may act emotionally, make mistakes, or have different values beyond pure profit maximization. Human behavior can be unpredictable and influenced by psychological factors like fear and trust.</li></ul><p>The most robust blockchain systems are designed to work effectively for both types of actors, balancing mathematical incentives with psychological considerations.</p>",

      "title": "The Prisoner's Dilemma in Blockchain",
      "html": "<p>The classic Prisoner's Dilemma illustrates a core challenge in blockchain consensus:</p><p>In a standard Prisoner's Dilemma, two individuals must decide whether to cooperate or defect without knowing what the other will choose. The best collective outcome happens when both cooperate, but individually, each is tempted to defect.</p><p>In blockchain validation, nodes face a similar dilemma:</p><ul><li>If all validators follow protocol rules (cooperate), the network is secure and everyone benefits</li><li>A validator might be tempted to break rules (defect) for short-term gain</li><li>If many validators break rules, the entire network suffers</li></ul><p>Blockchain protocols solve this through incentive mechanisms that align individual interests with network health.</p>"

      "title": "Nash Equilibrium in Blockchain Consensus",
      "html": "<p>A Nash Equilibrium occurs when no participant can gain by changing only their own strategy while others maintain theirs. In blockchain consensus:</p><p>For Proof of Work systems:</p><ul><li>The Nash Equilibrium is for miners to follow the protocol rules</li><li>Miners who try to cheat (e.g., by double-spending) will find their blocks rejected</li><li>Honest mining becomes the dominant strategy because dishonest blocks waste resources</li></ul><p>For Proof of Stake systems:</p><ul><li>Validators reach equilibrium by correctly validating transactions</li><li>Malicious behavior leads to slashing (losing staked funds)</li><li>The financial penalty creates strong disincentives against attacks</li></ul><p>Well-designed blockchain systems create Nash Equilibria where following the rules is the most profitable strategy.</p>"

      "title": "Coordination Games and Fork Choice",
      "html": "<p>Blockchain networks periodically face coordination problems where participants must choose between competing options:</p><p>For example, when the network forks (splits into two competing chains), miners/validators must choose which chain to build upon. This creates a coordination game where:</p><table class='comparison-table'><thead><tr><th>Solution Approach</th><th>Effectiveness (Rational)</th><th>Effectiveness (Human)</th><th>Handles Mass Defection</th><th>Complexity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Standard Numbering</td><td>High (P=0)</td><td>Medium</td><td>Fails if all defect</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Pairing/Watcher Solution</td><td>High (dominant)</td><td>Very High (P=0.001)</td><td>Prevents mass defection</td><td>Medium</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Fork choice rules like \"longest chain\" in Bitcoin act as Schelling points - focal solutions that participants naturally coordinate around without communication.</p>"

      "title": "Economic Security and Attack Costs",
      "html": "<p>Game theory helps us analyze blockchain security in economic terms:</p><p>For an attack to be rational, the expected profit must exceed the cost. Blockchain systems are designed so that:</p><ul><li><strong>Attack Cost</strong>: The resources required to attack the network (e.g., acquiring 51% of mining power or stake)</li><li><strong>Attack Reward</strong>: The potential profit from a successful attack</li><li><strong>Detection Probability</strong>: The likelihood that an attack will be detected and countered</li></ul><p>When <strong>Attack Cost > Attack Reward Ã— (1-Detection Probability)</strong>, rational actors won't attack the network.</p><p>Additionally, for valuable networks, attacking can destroy the value of the attacker's own holdings, further increasing the effective cost.</p>"

      "title": "Byzantine Generals Problem",
      "html": "<p>Blockchain consensus solves the Byzantine Generals Problem - how to reach agreement in a distributed system when some participants may be faulty or malicious.</p><p>In traditional computer systems, this was often solved through trusted third parties. Blockchain's innovation is using game theory and economic incentives to create byzantine fault tolerance without central authorities.</p><p>By aligning economic incentives with honest behavior, blockchain systems make it costly for malicious actors to disrupt consensus. This creates a system where even adversarial participants are incentivized to follow the protocol rules.</p>"
