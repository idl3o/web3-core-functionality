      "html": "<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to financial applications built on blockchain technology that aim to recreate and improve upon traditional financial systems without relying on centralized intermediaries like banks or brokerages.</p><p>DeFi leverages smart contracts to enable permissionless, transparent, and programmable financial services that anyone with an internet connection can access.</p><p>The DeFi ecosystem has grown rapidly since 2020, with billions of dollars in value locked in various protocols.</p>"

      "html": "<p>The DeFi ecosystem consists of several interconnected components:</p><ul><li><strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</strong>: Platforms like Uniswap and SushiSwap that allow peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies without intermediaries</li><li><strong>Lending and Borrowing</strong>: Protocols like Aave and Compound that enable users to lend their crypto assets and earn interest or borrow against collateral</li><li><strong>Stablecoins</strong>: Cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies (e.g., USDC, DAI)</li><li><strong>Yield Farming</strong>: Strategies to maximize returns by providing liquidity to protocols and earning rewards</li><li><strong>Automated Market Makers (AMMs)</strong>: Smart contracts that create liquidity pools and use algorithms to price assets</li><li><strong>Insurance</strong>: Protocols that provide coverage against smart contract risks and hacks</li><li><strong>Derivatives</strong>: Synthetic assets and prediction markets built on blockchain</li></ul>"
