# Git Repository Fix

The error message shows that your local Git repository is configured with an incorrect remote URL:
```
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/your-username/web3-core-functionality.git/' not found
```

## Steps to fix:

1. Update your Git remote to point to the correct repository:

```bash
# Change the remote URL to the correct repository
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/idl3o/idl3o.git

# Verify the remote has been updated successfully
git remote -v
```

2. Try pushing your branch again:

```bash
git push -u origin 001
```

If you want to create a new repository instead of using the existing one, you can:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `web3-core-functionality`
2. Push to that new repository:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-github-username/web3-core-functionality.git
git push -u origin 001
```

Replace `your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username.
